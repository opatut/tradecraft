# Tradecraft

Minecraft/Forge mod for easy trading using a virtual (not-item) currency. 

## Usage

For now you have to compile everything yourself. Clone this repository into your forge decompilation, as the 'mcp/src/minecraft/de/opatut/tradecraft/' directory. Sorry for not supplying a build system, but I am too lazy and don't want to put forge/mcp in here.
